## Discontinued project, changed to [OptEcoPrime](https://github.com/PlayerNguyen/OptEcoPrime)
This plugin is abandoned. Let's move to my new plugin, [OptEcoPrime](https://github.com/PlayerNguyen/OptEcoPrime). at the moment, OptEcoPrime has lots of utitlies and can be replaced by OptEco. If you are my OptEco users, please stand by for a while until I make a tool to convert database. Otherwise, you should ensure that your database will be lost.
